IntelliFraud: Bank Account Fraud Detection

## Goal
We aim to build a tool that detects fraudulent bank account opened through online applica-
tions in a consumer bank. We intend to find the insights from bank account opening data,
and use hybrid supervised boosting models like AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost and Light-
GBM models to detect fraudulent accounts. In practice, fraudulent individuals assume the
identity of another bank account holder with the aim of illicitly accessing banking services.
Once granted access, fraudulent individuals will max the accompanying line of credit, trans-
fer money or participate in other illegal financial activities. These costs are often sustained
by the bank, as tracing back these individuals can often be difficult, time consuming, and
expensive.

## How is it done today
Financial Fraud detection is accomplished through a combination of traditional and advanced
techniques which includes Transaction monitoring, Rule-Based systems, ML and AI, Behav-
ioral Analysis, Anomaly detection. Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
One of the major obstacles in developing a robust tool for detecting fraud come from the inherent complexity of the data. 
Take for example, the ratio of fraudulent transactions and genuine transactions. Often times a large
imbalance exists between these too, leading to an increase in the false positive rate and a
poor customer experience due to mis-classification.

## Our Approach
We will try to address some of these limitations by harnessing ensemble methodologies such
as (e.g., Random Forests) or boosting (e.g., AdaBoost) to amalgamate the predictive prowess
of multiple models. We have confidence that these methods will improve overall model
robustness and reduce the potential for overfitting. While there are many tools that focus on
identifying fraud, our approach will allow for end users to visualize and interact with the tools
developed by Intellifraud. We hope that Intellifraud serves as a creative canvas for subject
matter experts to improve upon existing methods, or the development of other tools.

## Who Cares ?
Data analytics departments in almost all banks and health care facilities [3] would care to
explore this tool as it would have the capability to improve the fraud detection and analysis
capabilities of those institutions. As an end user, bank customers, and hospitals dealing with
various kinds of financial frauds [13] would be happy to see the increased safety and strength
of fraud prevention teams.
